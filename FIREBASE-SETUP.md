# Firebase Setup Instructions for Living Things Memory Game

## Step 1: Create Firebase Project

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Click "Create a project" or "Add project"
3. Enter project name: `living-things-memory` (or any name you prefer)
4. Disable Google Analytics (not needed for this project)
5. Click "Create project"

## Step 2: Enable Firestore Database

1. In your Firebase project, click "Firestore Database" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Create database"
3. Choose "Start in test mode" (allows read/write for 30 days)
4. Select a location close to your students (e.g., europe-west1 for Europe)
5. Click "Done"

## Step 3: Get Firebase Configuration

1. Click the gear icon ‚öôÔ∏è ‚Üí "Project settings"
2. Scroll down to "Your apps" section
3. Click the web icon `</>`
4. Register app name: "Living Things Memory"
5. Don't check "Firebase Hosting" (we're using GitHub Pages)
6. Click "Register app"
7. Copy the configuration object that looks like this:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
  authDomain: "your-project.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "your-project-id",
  storageBucket: "your-project.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "123456789",
  appId: "1:123456789:web:abcdefghijklmnop"
};
```

## Step 4: Update the Game

1. Open `living-things.html`
2. Find the Firebase configuration section (around line 95)
3. Replace the placeholder values with your actual config:

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_ACTUAL_PROJECT.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_ACTUAL_APP_ID"
};
```

## Step 5: Update Firestore Rules (Optional - for better security)

1. Go to Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
2. Replace the default rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow read/write access to livingThingsScores collection
    match /livingThingsScores/{document} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Test the Game

1. Open your game and play a round
2. Check if the leaderboard shows "‚òÅÔ∏è Global Leaderboard (All Players)"
3. Scores should now be shared across all devices!

## Features After Setup:

‚úÖ **Global Leaderboard**: All students see the same scores
‚úÖ **Real-time Updates**: New scores appear for everyone
‚úÖ **Cross-device**: Play at home, see school scores
‚úÖ **Automatic Backup**: Still works offline with local storage
‚úÖ **Free Tier**: Firebase provides 50,000 reads/day free

## Troubleshooting:

- **"Firebase not available"**: Check your config values
- **No scores showing**: Check Firestore rules
- **Local scores only**: Firebase config might be incorrect

## Resetting the Leaderboard:

### Method 1: Using the Game Interface (Recommended)
1. Open the game and go to the leaderboard
2. Click the red "üóëÔ∏è Reset Leaderboard" button
3. Enter the teacher password: **Simeone2**
4. Click "Reset Leaderboard"
5. All scores (local and Firebase) will be cleared

**Teacher Password:** `Simeone2` (case-sensitive)

### Method 2: Firebase Console
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
2. Find the "livingThingsScores" collection
3. Delete individual documents or the entire collection
4. Students' local scores will remain until they play again

### Method 3: Browser Console (Local only)
1. Open the game page
2. Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab
3. Type: `localStorage.removeItem('livingThingsScores')`
4. Press Enter (only clears local scores)

### Method 4: Private/Incognito Mode
- Open the game in incognito mode for a clean slate
- No scores will be saved in this mode

## Security Note:

The current setup allows anyone to read/write scores. For a production classroom environment, consider implementing Firebase Authentication to restrict access to your students only.

‚úÖ **Security**: The reset button only appears when user "nemiroff" is logged in. It's also protected with a password (`Simeone2`) for double security.

**Access Control:**
- Only visible to: `nemiroff` user
- Password protected: `Simeone2`
- Other students: Cannot see or access the button

**To change the authorized user:**
1. Open `living-things-game.js`
2. Find the line: `if (currentUser === 'nemiroff') {`
3. Change `'nemiroff'` to your desired username
4. Save the file

**To change the password:**
1. Open `living-things-game.js`
2. Find the line: `const correctPassword = 'Simeone2';`
3. Change `'Simeone2'` to your desired password
4. Save the file
